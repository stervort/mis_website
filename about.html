<h2>Childhood</h2>
<p>I was born to Frank and Christine Tervort, on September 17, 1989.  I began my early life living in Genola Utah with my parents at my grandparents home while my Dad finished his accounting degree. After graduating BYU my Dad got a job in Idaho, and shortly after we moved up there.</p>  

<p>We didn't stay in Idaho long, maybe 2 years.  My parents soon decided that they wanted to live closer to family and relatives.  We moved back to Genola, but this time we were moving into a new home that my parents were building.</p>  

<h2>Teenage Years</h2>
<p>Genola is a pretty small town.  Just the way I like it.  I grew up only blocks away from cousins, so our family was pretty close with our extended family.</p>

<p>My grandparents owned a dairy farm that I worked on growing up.  It taught me a lot about the importance of hard work.  My grandparents were constantly going, and were a wonderful example to me growing up.</p>

<h2>College</h2>
<p>After finishing High school I started my college education.  It wasn't long before me and my wife decided to get married. We were both pretty young, but we didn't care.  It wasn't long after getting married that we found out our first born Brady was on his way.  We were excited as most parents would be, but this new stage in our lives would ultimately lead to me putting college on the back burner.</p>

<h2>Adult</h2>

<p>I have worked several jobs throughout the years, but my favorite job would have to be the job I have now.  Three years ago I was hired as a Correctional Officer with the Utah State Prison.  The job isn't easy, I work with some of the worst people in Utah, but I also work with a lot of really amazing people that are my fellow officers at the Gunnison Prison.  One of the biggest advantages to working in the prison is that I have been able to go back to school full time to finish my degree.</p> 

<p>I am Currently pursuing a degree in Accounting at USU. Here is a link to their website <a href="http://www.usu.edu">www.usu.edu</a>. At first I really struggled to decide what I wanted to do as a career.  For the longest time I thought that I wanted to be a computer programmer, or web page designer.  I am good with computers, but I have also always been interested in going into the family trade and becoming an accounant like my Dad, and that is ultimately what I decided to do.</p>  

<p>I am well on my way to finally earning my degree.  I have been going pretty strong for the last two years going full time not only during regular semesters, but also during the summer semester.  If all goes as planned, I should have my degree in under 2 years.
