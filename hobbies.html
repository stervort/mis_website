<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>I am always looking to learn something new.  I have had many hobbies over the years, but here are a few of my current hobbies that I do when I am not at work or doing homework.</p>

<div class="clear"><img src="guitar.jpg" width="300" alt="picture of a guitar."><h2>Music</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest hobby I have is music.  I love music.  From a very early age I learned to play the piano.  I grew up with my grandpa, who played the piano by ear very well.  I later took 6 years of piano lessons growing up, and was constantly playing.  I inherited my grandpa's ability to play by ear.  I was once grounded from playing the piano, because it was distracting me from doing homework.  Sounds silly, but it was absolutely reasonable at the time. I don't play as much now, but still spend a fair amount of time playing.</p>

<p>I also play the guitar.  Between the guitar and piano, I could burn an entire day playing around.  I taught myself to play the guitar and have written a few songs.</p></div>

<div class="clear"><img src="flutes.png" width="300" alt="collage of branch flutes I have made."><h2>Woodworking</h2>
<p>I aquired my interest in woodworking during my high school years.  I took woodshop classes nearly every year starting in 8th grade.</p>
<p>I make a lot of things, but the last few years I have been making Native American Flutes.  I started making flutes about 4 year ago, and eventually found my way to making branch flutes.</p>  

<p>The branch flutes I make are made after the Native American Flute style.  Over the last few years I have grown the hobby into a small business.  I don’t sell very many flutes, because of school and my day job, but I hope to one day make a significant portion of my income off of my woodworking projects. Here is a link to my website where I sell my flutes <a href="http://www.BranchFlutes.com">BranchFlutes.com</a>.</p></div>  

<div class="clear"><img src="garden.jpg" class="clear" width="300" alt="picture of last years garden."><h2>Gardening</h2>
<p>Gardening is one of my favorite hobbies.  It only comes second to music, but it is a very close second.  I developed a love for gardening from my dad, who always had a beautiful vegetable garden growing.  I don't grow anything too fancy, I just enjoy growing good vegetables to feed my family during the summer.  The picture to the left is of last years garden.</p></div>

<div class="clear"><h2>Favorite Shows</h2>
<p>Finally, when there is nothing else I can be doing, I love sitting down to a good show. Watching movies is usually pretty low on the priority list so I am usually not caught up.  That is okay though, I find that I enjoy binge watching after the seasons are over.  I hate the suspense of waiting for the next episode.  Anyway, below is a list of some of my favorite shows to watch.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Walking Dead</a>
<li>The last Man on Earth</a>
<li>Breaking Bad</a>
<li>Sons of Anarchy</a>
<li>Master Chef</li>
</ol>
