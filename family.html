<h2>Meet My Family</h2><p>This is one of my favorite family pictures.  It is a photo of my wife Hannah and my two boys. Brady is in the blue shirt, and Riley is wearing the green shirt.</p>  

 

<div class="clear"><img src="hannah.jpg" width="300" alt="picture of my Hannah."><h2>Hannah</h2><p>Me and Hannah were high school sweethearts.  Our life together started our Junior year of high school.  We didn't actually know each other at this time.  We knew of each other but had never really talked to each other.  Luckily enough, we both signed up to go on a school trip to Washington D.C.  We were placed in the same group together and quicly became friends.</p>
<p>After our Senior year, we both started college.  Hannah was also Miss Santaquin at the time.  We were both really busy and spent all of the little freetime we had together.</p>
<p>In October of 2009, we were married.  We weren't a two person family for very long.  Eleven months later, our lives were changed forever when Brady was born.</p></div>    

<div class="clear"><img src="brady.jpg" class="clear" width="300" alt="picture of Brady outside playing in the dirt."><br><h2>Brady</h2><p>Brady was born September 2, 2010.  He has always been a happy kid.  I picked the picture to the left because it is a picture that shows one of his favorite things in the world to do, play outside.  Brady is a very smart boy and is always trying to figure out how things work.  He loves to build things, but mostly he loves playing in the dirt with his brother Riley.</p>
<p>Brady turned five this year and has just started preschool.  This year has been a big year for him.  He got a new bike for his birthday, and learned to ride it without training wheels after only two days of riding.  He is pretty proud of his accomplishment, and tells everyone that he meets that he can ride his bike without trainging wheels.</p></div>

<div class="clear"><img src="riley.jpg" class="clear" width="300" alt="Picture of Riely holding a fish that he caught"><h2>Riley</h2><p>Riley was born on October 14, 2011.  Riley has always been a little spit fire.  He is very smart, and sometimes I forget that I am talking to a 4 year old.  Riley is really competitvive and is always tring to do everything his big brother is doing.</p> 
<p>Riley loves playing outside, but sometimes just enjoys sitting down to a good episode of spider man.  Riley has been obsessed with spider man for a very long time, and at one time requested that his mom call him Peter Parker.</p>
<p>Riley really likes to go fishing.  The picture to the left shows the large catfish he caught this year.  It was nearly bigger than him, and required his mom's assistance in holding it up for the camera.</p></div>
